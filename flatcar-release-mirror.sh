# This script mirrors the Flatcar release server to the current directory.
# It creates a subfolder per release channel and updates its contents when rerun.
# The folder for https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/
# will be called stable, and the same applies to alpha, beta, and edge.
# Files are only created and never deleted. Files per release channel are downloaded
# sequential, but all release channels are downloaded in parallel.
# It supports flags to filter limit the downloading to new releases
# or to exclude certain image files by pattern. A detailed log can be enabled.
